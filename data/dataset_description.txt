Both datasets consist of the following features separated by comma in the following order:

user_ip 		# user identification (IP address) - anonymized
domain 			# top level domail (TLD)
timestamp 		# timestamp of the request
attack 			# indicator if the request is malicious (True/False) 
request 		# request text
len 			# length of the request (without TLD) -> length(something.google.com) = 9 (not counting .google.com) 
subdomains_count 	# number of subdomains (without TLD)  -> subdomains_count(something.there.google.com) = 2 (not counting .google.com) 
w_count 		# number of English words in the request
w_max			# lenght of the longest English word in the request
entropy 		# entropy of DNS request 
w_max_ratio		# longest English word length to request length ratio 
w_count_ratio		# number of English words to request lenght ratio 
digits_ratio		# percentage of digits in the request
uppercase_ratio		# percentage of capital letter in the request

# The following features are calculated using the current and the previous 9 requests (window size = 10).
# Requests are grouped by (user_ip, domain) key.

time_avg 		# average time between requests
time_stdev 		# standard deviation of times between requests
size_avg 		# average size (length) of the requests
size stdev 		# standard deviation of sizes of requests
throughput 		# number of characters in requests transmitted per second
unique 			# uniqueness indicator with values in range [0-1] (0 - all requests are equal, 1 - all requests are different)
entropy_avg		# average value of entropy
entropy_stdev 		# standard deviation of entropy
